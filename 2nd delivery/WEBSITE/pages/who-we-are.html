                In order to accommodate the future and be a part of it, TIM is also renewed in the brand.
                Since its birth, more than 20 years ago, its logo was a sign of modernity and dynamism: a promise of projects and new horizons. Today icontinues to be a symbol of change, combining the expertise of two realities: the red trigram of Telecom Italia, the intense blue of the TIM brand and a T to unite these two worlds.
                The synthesis of a great legacy and a strong orientation to the future.
                The result is a simple and instant icon: evolved, for evolved times.
